# AGSIFL

This is the official Pytorch implementation of our paper: "Adaptive-fusion of Geometric and Semantic Information for Floorplan Localization "

## Setup

We conducted experiments based on F<sup>3</sup>Loc and OneFormer. You can download the dataset from F<sup>3</sup>Loc and use its depth estimation method. You need to download relevant checkpoints in OneFormer to support semantic segmentation for subsequent tasks.


We use the extracted CLIP and I3D features for ShanghaiTech, UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets from the following works:

[F<sup>3</sup>Loc](https://github.com/felix-ch/f3loc) 

[OneFormer](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/OneFormer)
